<b>CMake by Example</b> is a hands-on introduction to CMake using annotated
example projects. Get started with [the hello world example](/executable/) or click on any of
the links below. You are encouraged to copy-paste bits from these examples into
your own projects as needed.

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is the de-facto standard for building C++ code, with over 2 million downloads a month. It‚Äôs a powerful, comprehensive solution for managing the software build process.
