## What is CPM.cmake?

> CPM.cmake is a cross-platform CMake script that adds dependency management capabilities to CMake. It's built as a thin wrapper around CMake's FetchContent module that adds version control, caching, a simple API and more.

Quick installation instructions:

```sh

```

```cmake
include(cmake/CPM.cmake)
CPMAddPackage(...)
```

> - **Small and reusable projects** CPM takes care of all project dependencies, allowing developers to focus on creating small, well-tested libraries.
> - **Cross-Platform** CPM adds projects directly at the configure stage and is compatible with all CMake toolchains and generators.
> - **Reproducible builds** By versioning dependencies via git commits or tags it is ensured that a project will always be buildable.
> - **Recursive dependencies** Ensures that no dependency is added twice and all are added in the minimum required version.
> - **Plug-and-play** No need to install anything. Just add the script to your project and you're good to go.
> - **No packaging required** Simply add all external sources as a dependency.
> - **Simple source distribution** CPM makes including projects with source files and dependencies easy, reducing the need for monolithic header files or git submodules.
